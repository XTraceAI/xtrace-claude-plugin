description: Use when the user asks to save, store, or upload a file/document/spec to MemHub or team memory as an artifact (e.g. "save this spec to memhub", "store this doc as an artifact", "version this design doc in memhub"). Uploads the file's bytes via a terminal script — never call save_artifact directly or re-emit file contents.

**Plugin root:** commands below use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. Claude Code and
Codex export it automatically; if it is unset (e.g. on Cursor), set it first to
this plugin's root — the ancestor directory of this skill file that contains
`.claude-plugin/` — with `export CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT="<plugin-root>"`.

Store an existing file as a MemHub artifact. The file's bytes are uploaded by a
helper script — **for content that already exists on disk, do NOT call the
`save_artifact` MCP tool yourself and do NOT paste/retype the file contents**;
that would regenerate the whole document token by token. This is a terminal
operation, like `cat`-ing a file. Content you compose in-session and that
lives nowhere on disk (a handoff brief, a PR review record) is the other case:
there, calling `save_artifact` directly is fine — nothing is being re-emitted.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`
- First token = the path to the file to store (required). If invoked without a
  path (e.g. the user said "save this to memhub" about a file just discussed),
  use that file's path; ask if ambiguous.
- Remaining text = the artifact name (optional; if omitted, use the file's base
  name as a readable title).

**One canonical artifact per topic.** When a conclusion changes, VERSION that
artifact — re-upload under the same `--name` into the same brain and the
server chains it onto the lineage's head — never publish a parallel one.
Retrieval is semantic, so an un-retracted stale claim can outrank its own
correction and mislead the next agent. Before uploading something that
restates or corrects existing knowledge, `search_memory` (`kind:
"artifact"`) for the artifact it supersedes and reuse its exact name; if a
prior conclusion is now wrong, say so explicitly in the new version rather
than leaving both to compete. `--parent-id` exists for explicit chaining but
must be the CURRENT latest version's id (the server rejects an older one as
`parent_stale`) — the same name is simpler and never stale.

Do exactly this:

1. Resolve the file path (`$1`) and a name. If no name was given, derive a short
   Title-Case name from the filename.
2. Pick an `artifact_type` from the extension/content: `spec`, `design_doc`,
   `plan`, `runbook`, or `document` (default). These are the types the brain's
   Index groups by; anything else folds into Documents — so an ADR goes in as
   `design_doc`, not `adr`, to land under Design.
3. Run the upload via Bash — substitute the real values, keep it one command:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/save_artifact.py" \
     --file "<path>" --name "<name>" --type "<type>" --tags "<a,b>" --topic "<topic>"
   ```

   A file inside a git repo routes to that repo's room automatically — from
   the cache in `~/.config/memhub-plugin/rooms.json`, or resolved from the
   server when the cache is empty (the script prints which room it used) — so
   it lands where teammates search without any extra flag. A file outside any
   repo goes to personal memory unless you pass `--agent-brain-id`.

   Optional flags when relevant: `--agent-brain-id <id>` to override the
   destination brain (its org is worked out from the id; `--org-id <org>` is
   accepted but no longer needed), `--no-room` to save into personal workspace memory
   instead, `--rationale "..."` to note why this version supersedes the last,
   `--parent-id <id>` only with the current head's id.

   **Always pass `--tags`.** Two or three topic words is enough
   (`--tags retry,reliability`); the server normalises them to lowercase
   snake_case, so `Skill-Design` is stored as `skill_design` and searches
   normalise the same way. Tags are what a later `search_memory(tags=…)` can
   filter on, and an org with required tags turned on REFUSES an untagged save
   and answers with the brain's own tag vocabulary — pick from what it offers
   and re-run rather than inventing a new word. `list_tags` shows that
   vocabulary up front if you'd rather choose before the first try.

   **Pass `--topic` when saving into a brain** — the chapter of the brain the
   document belongs under, which is what its table of contents is built from.
   In this order: an existing topic of the brain when one fits, even loosely;
   a new one only for a subject none covers, broad enough that others will
   land there; else `unsorted`. A brain with topics on refuses a NEW artifact
   without one and lists its topics in the refusal — choose from them and
   re-run. A new version keeps its topic when `--topic` is omitted. How to see
   the topics and what the server does with the answer:
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/topics.md`.

4. **A rendered deliverable — an HTML page, a chart PNG, a PDF — goes through
   `--attach`, not `--file`.** `--file` reads UTF-8 text; a deliverable is
   bytes, and they are base64-encoded by the script so they never pass through
   your context either:

   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/save_artifact.py" \
     --attach "<rendered file>" [--attach "<another>"] \
     [--entrypoint "<the file to render first>"] \
     [--file "<a short text summary>"] --name "<name>" --type document
   ```

   `--attach` is repeatable, and the bundle keeps the structure **below the
   attachments' common parent** — `--attach build/index.html --attach
   build/assets/chart.png` stores `index.html` and `assets/chart.png`, so a
   page that references `assets/chart.png` still resolves it. Attach every file
   the page needs, not just the page: a deliverable uploaded without its
   stylesheet or images renders broken and looks like a server fault.
   `--entrypoint` takes the bundle path (`index.html` here), and a lone
   attachment keeps its basename. Attach the paths the page references, symlinks
   and all: the bundle path follows what you pass, so a symlinked `assets/`
   directory stays `assets/` instead of becoming its link target. Give a text body too whenever you have one:
   the bytes are the payload, the text is what makes the deliverable findable
   by search. Keep the bundle to a few MB. `ingest_document_from_url` is not
   an escape hatch for a big local file — it takes a public `https://` URL and
   the server fetches it; a large file with no public URL needs trimming or
   splitting.
5. Report the returned `{id, action}` to the user, **and which brain it landed
   in, by name** — automatic routing that happens silently reads as losing
   things. `action: "existing"` means these exact bytes were already saved as
   ANOTHER artifact in that brain: the returned `id`/`name` are that one's,
   your `--name` was not used, and nothing new was written — report that name,
   since it is the one to version later. On first ever run the script may open the browser once for approval
   and then mint a personal access key (`mhk_…`) that later runs reuse without
   one — that is expected, not an error. It is the plugin's own credential, not
   the `/mcp` connector's; `/memhub:login` provisions it up front if you would
   rather not be interrupted mid-save.

You only emit the short command with a path — the script reads the file and
ships it to `save_artifact`.
