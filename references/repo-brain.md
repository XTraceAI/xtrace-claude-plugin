# The repo brain — naming, resolution, and creation rules

The canonical rules for turning a git repository into its MemHub agent brain
("the repo room"). Every skill that touches a repo brain follows this file.

Each skill states the common-path rule inline, so the normal case costs no
read. Come here for the edge cases and for the rules that apply whenever a
skill is about to CREATE a brain.

---

## 1. The name

```
Repo: <org>/<name>
```

Derived from `git remote get-url origin`. This name is a **lookup key** — a
brain is found by matching it EXACTLY, so every skill must derive it
identically. A one-character difference silently creates a second brain for
the same repo, and the two rooms never see each other's memory.

Normalization, in order:

1. Read `git remote get-url origin`.
2. Strip the transport and host. Both remote forms must produce the same
   result:
   - HTTPS — `https://github.com/XTraceAI/xmem.git` → `XTraceAI/xmem`
   - SSH — `git@github.com:XTraceAI/xmem.git` → `XTraceAI/xmem`
   - SSH URL — `ssh://git@github.com/XTraceAI/xmem.git` → `XTraceAI/xmem`
3. Strip a trailing `.git` and any trailing `/`.
4. Keep only the last two path segments (`<org>/<name>`). Self-hosted hosts
   can nest deeper (e.g. `gitlab.example.com/group/subgroup/repo`) — take
   `subgroup/repo`.
5. **Preserve case exactly as the remote gives it.** Do not lowercase.
   `XTraceAI/xmem` and `xtraceai/xmem` are different brains; the remote is
   the tiebreaker.
6. Prefix with `Repo: ` (one space).

Result: `Repo: XTraceAI/xmem`.

**A remote with no org** (`git@host:name.git`, common on self-hosted servers)
yields a one-segment `Repo: name`. Keep it — the remote is still stable across
clones and worktrees, which is the property the key needs. Do NOT substitute
the no-remote fallback below: that keys on a local directory basename, which
differs between clones and would split the room. Note the resulting name is
shaped like the no-remote form, so a no-remote repo whose directory happens to
share that basename lands in the same room; prefer `room_map.py name` over
deriving by hand so every caller at least agrees.

## 2. Edge cases

**Worktrees and subdirectories.** All worktrees of a repo, and any
subdirectory within it, resolve to the SAME brain — because `origin` is the
same. Never derive the name from the current directory when a remote exists.
This is why the remote, not the path, is the source of truth. The no-remote
fallback below preserves this guarantee by keying on the main worktree rather
than the current one.

**Monorepos.** One repo is one brain. Do not invent per-package brains; the
package is a detail inside the room, not a room of its own.

**Multiple remotes.** Use `origin`. If `origin` is missing but other remotes
exist, do NOT guess which is canonical — ask the user which remote to use,
or apply the no-remote rule below if they don't care.

**No remote, but inside a git repo.** Derive from the MAIN worktree, never
from the current directory — in a linked worktree `git rev-parse
--show-toplevel` returns *that worktree's* path, so every worktree of one
repo would get a different name:

```sh
git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir   # → /path/to/repo/.git
```

Do NOT blindly take the parent directory — that only works for the standard
layout. Normalize: if the last path component is exactly `.git`, drop it;
then strip a trailing `.git` extension from what remains; then take the
basename.

```
/path/to/repo/.git   → /path/to/repo   → repo    (standard worktree)
/path/to/repo.git    → /path/to/repo   → repo    (bare repo)
/path/to/repo        → /path/to/repo   → repo    (custom GIT_DIR)
```

Taking the parent unconditionally would name the brain after the CONTAINING
directory in the latter two cases — a wrong lookup key, which mints an
unfindable room.

```
Repo: <basename>
```

**This name can never match a remote-derived `Repo: <org>/<name>`** — it has
one segment where that has two, and there is no way to recover the org
without a remote. So it is a genuinely DISTINCT brain, not the same room
under a shorter name. Say so out loud and confirm before creating one: if the
repo has a remote anywhere else (a teammate's clone, CI), their room is the
two-segment one, and creating this would fork the repo's memory in exactly
the way §1 warns about.

**Not a git repository at all.** Do NOT invent a repo name. Fall back to
plain workspace memory (omit `agent_brain_id` entirely), and **tell the user
that's what happened** — e.g. "not in a git repo, so this went to your
workspace memory rather than a repo brain." Silently inventing a brain name
here is how unfindable one-off brains get created. MemHub is used outside
code repos (meetings, documents, research); that path is legitimate and must
not be forced into a repo shape.

## 3. Resolve before you create — ALWAYS

Creating a brain is the last resort, never the first move.

1. Derive the name (§1).
2. `list_agent_brains(repo="<org>/<name>")` — the §1 name without the
   `Repo: ` prefix; it looks across every org you are in — then keep only an
   **exact-name match**. Reuse that `agent_brain_id` if found — a teammate
   may have created the room, and theirs is the right one.
3. *Optional*, when a person is in the loop to judge a near-match: run
   `list_agent_brains(query="…")` with the repo or topic in natural language
   — it ranks brains, and an existing one may hold this subject under a
   different name. The skills that resolve a repo room (onboard, pr-babysit)
   skip it: the exact name is the dedup that matters.
4. No exact match: `create_agent_brain` with `name: "Repo: <org>/<name>"`,
   `category: "repo"`, a description (§5), and **`repo: "<org>/<name>"`** —
   the §1 name without the `Repo: ` prefix. Omit `workspace_id`. `repo` ties
   the brain to the repository on the server: when the org has granted that
   GitHub repo to a workspace, the brain is bound there (and the grant
   already auto-created a `Repo: <org>/<name>` brain, so there is usually one
   to find); when it has not, the brain is created unbound (`repo.bound:
   false`) and **the server does not refuse a second one** — step 2's
   exact-name match is the only guard. A later grant adopts the unbound brain
   only when it is the ONLY one for that repo; with two, it adopts neither and
   creates a third. Read the error
   **message** — the tool passes back text, not a reason code:
   - `Repo brain already exists: <name> (<id>)` → the repo's bound brain
     exists but you could not see it in step 2. Reuse the id in the
     parentheses; do not create another. (Not visible usually means not
     shared with you — if a write to it is refused, ask for it to be shared.)
   - `Repo brain governance requires an org admin` → the repo is granted and
     only an org admin may create its brain. Retry the same call **without**
     `repo`, and tell the user an admin-owned brain for this repo exists
     that an admin can share with them.
   - `Use a GitHub URL or owner/repo` / `Use a repository name or owner/repo`
     → the server could not parse the name (rare); retry without `repo`.

   Omitting `workspace_id` lands an unbound brain in your own workspace, so
   you keep the contributor access that sharing requires; a bound brain
   lands in the grant's workspace, and you still hold it as its creator.

Duplicate brains are the main way a MemHub org degrades: cross-brain routing
ranks brains by their overview, so several near-identical rooms on one
subject make the right one harder to find for every future search.

## 4. Cache the resolution — resolve once, route from then on

Once §3 gives you an id, **persist it** so later writers don't redo the lookup:

```sh
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/room_map.py" set --brain-id "<ROOM>" [--org-id "<ORG_ID>"]
```

`--org-id` is the org that owns the brain, when you know it — the brain row
or `create_agent_brain`'s answer names it. It is optional: the server works a
brain's org out from its id, so an id cached without its org still routes.
An entry cached without it is re-probed (rate-limited, once a day) in case
the org can be recorded.

That writes `~/.config/memhub-plugin/rooms.json` — the plugin's per-user state
dir, alongside the OAuth token cache. **Never inside the repo.** A brain id is
account state, not project state: writing it into the working tree would push a
private id into whatever repo the user happens to be in, including public ones,
and force every user to decide whether to commit it.

Entries are keyed by the repo's room name (§1), then by backend (`production` /
`staging` hold different ids for the same repo, so a single flat id would write
to the wrong brain on whichever install didn't match).

Read it back — bare id on stdout, exit 1 and silence when nothing is cached:

```sh
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/room_map.py" show
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/room_map.py" name   # the §1 name
```

Who reads it: the ARTIFACT writers. `save_artifact.py` and the `.md`
auto-capture at the end of a turn resolve the room themselves on a cache miss
(`brain_resolve.resolve_repo_brain` asks `list_agent_brains(repo=…)`, keeps
the exact-name match, and caches the answer), and a write the backend answers "Agent brain not found" for evicts
the entry so the next one resolves again. `save_artifact.py` reads the cache
when `--agent-brain-id` is not passed (`--no-room` opts out), so a plain
invocation lands in the room. The cache makes that resolution a once-per-repo
cost, records the org that owns the room when it is known (`set --org-id`),
and collapses five skills' worth of
independent re-derivation into one answer, which is the drift §1 warns about.

Who never reads it: session capture. The per-turn Stop flush, the SessionEnd
hook, the commit/PR flush, the Codex and Cursor hooks and `capture.py import`
send every session to the author's **personal memory, never to a brain** —
the room included. A session is the author's, and the server pins a session to
the first brain any flush names, so a single routed flush would pull its whole
memory into the room. Team-visible knowledge reaches the room as artifacts.

Because the key is the room NAME (derived from the remote), every worktree and
subdirectory of a repo shares one entry automatically, with no dependence on
which branch is checked out. Each teammate resolves once on their own machine —
one `list_agent_brains` call — which is the price of keeping the id out of the
working tree.

## 5. Every brain you create needs a real description

`create_agent_brain` accepts a `description`. It is not decoration — it is
the text an agent reads when choosing between brains, and a brain with no
description is effectively invisible when picking from a list.

Write one line answering **what questions this brain can answer**. Name the
subject and the kind of content.

- Good — "Shared room for the xmem repo: specs, design docs and PR review
  records."
- Useless — "xmem stuff", "notes", or an empty description.

## 6. Say where things landed

After any write, tell the user which brain received it, by name:

> Saved to `Repo: XTraceAI/xmem`.

Routing that happens silently reads as losing things. One line keeps
automatic placement trustworthy, and lets the user correct a wrong
destination immediately rather than discovering it weeks later.
