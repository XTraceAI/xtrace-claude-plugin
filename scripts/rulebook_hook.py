"""Rulebook hook — three delivery lanes for team engineering rules.

Lanes (the mode argument):
  session  SessionStart: posture rules (on="session") in full, everything else
           as ONE compact index line. Session start is the weakest attention
           slot, so it carries worldview, never enforcement.
  pre      PreToolUse: advisories at the violation moment (on="bash", "edit",
           "read", "write_stdlib") and the ordering-rule GATE (on="ordering").
           A read rule sees the Read tool AND shell reads (cat/head/sed -n …).
  post     PostToolUse: advisories on failing results (on="result");
           ordering-rule ARM (edit-family) and RECEIPT (bash).
  fetch    Refresh the server book for one repo (GET /rules?view=hook with
           If-None-Match) into <BASE>/book/<repo>.json. Spawned DETACHED.
  flush    Stop / SessionEnd: POST unsent ledger rows to /fires in batches
           behind a sent-watermark (ledger/.sent); `flush final` ignores the
           throttle. Open obligations still unconverted at the second Stop
           after their fire are first recorded `converted=false`; a later
           conversion still wins (the server keeps a true over a false).

Book = the server book, cached with its ETag. SessionStart re-fetches a stale
one BEFORE the digest renders; the pre lane refreshes it in the background once
it is a minute old. Offline → the cached book; no cache → no rules. Rules are
authored through the memhub `create_rule` tool, never a local file.

One book, several rulebooks: the fetched book is the union of every rulebook
that binds the person, each rule carrying `rulebook_id` and a `rulebook` block
(`name`, `scope`, `member_count`). The server computes no precedence (D14);
`book_rank` orders wider books first so the caps spend on the policy binding
the most people — an ordering, never a suppression. A backend that sends no
book facts ranks every rule alike, and the stable sorts keep old behaviour.

How a fire reaches people (spec §5.3):
  * Every fire is DISCLOSED as `📏 Rule fired: <rule, ≤ 20 words>` (`⛔️` when
    a gate stopped the call): to the user in `systemMessage`, and to the agent,
    told to echo the byte-identical line, since only the agent's copy reaches
    the transcript. `disclosure_line` builds both.
  * `mode: gate` rules BLOCK (`permissionDecision: deny`) with the override
    their lane accepts: Bash takes `RULEBOOK_OVERRIDE='<why>' <command>`; an
    edit takes a `rulebook-override[<rule>]: <why>` marker in the content
    (named, because it stays in the diff); a Read is retried narrower,
    delegated, or run as an overridden `cat`. The fire records its
    `override_reason`; the next matching call is gated again. Gates are never
    deduped nor capped. Result rules and the shell-written-files lane run
    after the fact and cannot gate.
  * A gate is honoured from whatever book is cached, however old: a stale gate
    costs one override, a gate that silently lapses offline is the failure a
    gate exists to prevent.

What leaves the machine, exactly:
  * fetch  — the repo name, nothing else.
  * fires  — identifiers only (rule, session, repo, branch, tool, timestamps,
             judge score/verdict). The `excerpt` stays in the LOCAL ledger.
  * recall — the anchor lane sends the file path or the command line (heredoc
             bodies dropped, credentials redacted by denylist, ≤ 400 chars).
             `MEMHUB_RULEBOOK_RECALL=0` turns it off.
  * judge  — `POST /judge` sends the person's message (≤ 2000 chars), the
             stripped turn, the call (≤ 600 chars) and the fired rule ids,
             through the harness window's denylists — a floor, not a
             guarantee. An org without `rule_judge` gets `disabled`, and the
             hook then asks at most once per ten minutes per machine. One
             verdict per rule per turn is cached. `MEMHUB_RULEBOOK_JUDGE=0`
             turns it off.

Usage (wired in hooks.json): printf %s "$IN" | python3 rulebook_hook.py {session|pre|post}

State lives under $MEMHUB_RULEBOOK_BASE, else ~/.config/memhub-plugin/rulebook.
Stdlib only; every failure path exits 0 with no output.

Two engines, one evaluate():
  * matcher rules — `evaluate()` is a pure function of (rule, event).
  * ordering rules — "run X after the last edit, before Y": an obligation
    state machine keyed by (worktree_root, branch, rule), never by session,
    so receipts from subagents and sibling sessions count.

A matcher rule's `given` block adds predicates checked AFTER its regex matched
— `repo`, `user`, `file` and `agent` facts, answered lazily by `Probes`. A
fact that cannot be established never satisfies a predicate. `given_ok()` is
pure over a Probes and the event's read facts.

    Keyed by WORKTREE, not branch: a working tree carries uncommitted edits
    across `git checkout -b`, so a branch-keyed obligation would vanish on a
    branch switch before the push. Sibling branches share it (over-gates
    slightly — the safe direction).
    Every read-modify-write holds an exclusive flock on a sidecar lock (bounded
    LOCK_WAIT_S, then fail open) and replaces the file atomically, so an arm
    and a discharge from two sessions never overwrite each other.

    Arming counters ONLY: a receipt is posted as an event carrying this
    checkout's key and the server matches it to the rule's fires

#
# `/recall` is the one lane that sends content rather than identifiers: the
# server's relevance judge decides whether an anchor rule applies to THIS call,
# and it cannot do that from a rule id. So the command line goes with it.
#
# A command line is also where credentials live — `curl -H "Authorization:
# Bearer …"`, `psql postgres://user:pw@host`, `--token=…`. Those are worth
# nothing to the judge and must not reach a model, so they are replaced before
# the POST. `shell_only` has already dropped heredoc bodies by this point, so
# what remains is the shell line itself.
#
# This is a denylist and cannot be complete — the docstring and the README say
# so, and `MEMHUB_RULEBOOK_RECALL=0` turns the lane off entirely for anyone who
# would rather not send command text at all. It is a floor, not a guarantee.
_REDACTIONS = (
    # `--token=x`, `--password x`, `API_KEY=x` — the value, not the flag, so the
    # judge still sees that a credential was passed. A quoted value
    # (`--token='x'`, `PGPASSWORD="two words"`) goes whole, quotes and all.
    #
    # `auth` is deliberately NOT in this list even though it names plenty of
    # real secrets: it also names `gh auth login`, `--auth-mode`, `auth0_sub`,
    # and eating the word after those costs the judge the verb of the command
    # for nothing. The `Authorization:` header has its own rule below, which is
    # where `auth` actually carries a credential.
    # The key must END with the credential word. Allowing a trailing suffix
    # matched `--token-budget 500` and ate the number, which is not a secret and
    # is exactly the kind of over-redaction that degrades the judge on ordinary
