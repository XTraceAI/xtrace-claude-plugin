"""Per-turn session flush — fired by the Stop hook after every assistant turn.

Ships only the transcript BYTES WRITTEN SINCE THE LAST SUCCESSFUL FLUSH, using
``flush="auto"`` so the server stores each turn durably on arrival but extracts
only once the accumulated span is batch-sized. Extracting per turn would hand
the batch extractor a 2-5 event fragment and shred the episode boundaries it
derives; buffering server-side keeps episodes whole while making each turn
durable the moment it happens.

**Why a byte cursor and not "re-send the transcript".** Re-sending the whole
file every turn needs no client state, and the server's uuid watermark makes it
correct — but it re-uploads the entire session on each turn, so total upload
grows with the SQUARE of the session length. On a long coding session that is
gigabytes to say what a few kilobytes would. So the client sends its delta and
the server holds what it has not yet extracted.

**The cursor advances only on success.** Every uncertainty resolves toward
re-sending: no cursor, a shrunken file, a failed call, an ambiguous response.
The server dedups incoming records against (extracted ∪ buffered), so
over-sending costs bandwidth while under-sending leaves a gap nothing will ever
notice. That asymmetry is the whole reason this file is written the way it is.

**The delta is BOUNDED, and the cursor tracks what was sent, not what was
read.** Individual records have long been capped; the aggregate was not. So a
session whose pending delta outgrew the server's request limit got a 413 on
every turn, could not advance a cursor past bytes that were never sent, and
re-sent the same ever-growing delta forever — per-turn capture dead for the
rest of that session's life, on exactly the long sessions worth keeping. The
delta now goes through the same splitter the whole-transcript paths use and
only the first slice ships, with the cursor landing on the last record in it.
A backlog drains over the next few turns because steady-state deltas are
kilobytes; ``flush_session`` remains the backstop for whatever a session ends
before reaching.

**One flush per session at a time.** The server expects a session's turns to
arrive in order, so an advisory ``flock`` keeps two hooks from overlapping when
one turn finishes before the previous flush has returned. Losing that race is
not an error: the cursor did not move, so the next turn's flush carries both.

Discipline mirrors the other capture hooks: THIS SCRIPT NEVER FAILS LOUDLY.
Any error exits 0 quietly — memory capture must never disturb the session.

Auth = the plugin's OWN token cache (shared ``_memhub_auth``) — a different
store from the /mcp connector's, so being connected in /mcp does NOT mean this
hook can authenticate. Non-interactive: a per-turn background hook must never
pop a browser, so it can only consume a token ``/memhub:login`` already minted.

    # carry a message record yet cannot fit the limit has no legal form.

        # deliberate degrade, not a break: per-turn goes dormant while
        # the commit/PR and SessionEnd paths keep capturing, so there
        # is nothing the user must drop what they are doing to fix.
        #
        # It also cannot be retracted. Dormancy means no further flush
        # runs, so no success can ever clear a breadcrumb — and because
        # the condition is environmental, every NEW session rediscovers
        # it and warns again. That is a banner on every session start
        # for a day, about a known state with a working fallback, which
        # is precisely how a warning becomes wallpaper and stops being
        # read on the day it matters.
        #
        # Surfacing it properly needs a once-ever channel keyed by
        # server, not the per-session one; until then the log line
        # above records it.
        # Clears THIS path's stale error, and deliberately does NOT stamp
        # `last_ok_at`.
        #
        # Stamping one was a bug: since the health check retracts a failure when
        # any path reports success for the same session, a success recorded here
        # would silently retract a REAL failure the SessionEnd backstop had
        # recorded — reintroducing the invisible capture failure this whole
        # series exists to remove, and doing it from a branch that captured
        # nothing.
        #
        # Clearing the error is still right: dormancy means no later per-turn
        # flush runs to retract it, so an older error would be stranded forever.
        # But this branch speaks only for itself. It reached the server and got
        # an answer; it did not capture anything, so it is in no position to
        # vouch for another path.
