"""Store an artifact from a FILE (or stdin) — a terminal operation.

The point: the artifact body is read off disk / the pipe and shipped straight
to the `save_artifact` MCP tool. The model never re-emits the content token by
token — it just runs this with a path, the same way it would `cat` a file.

`--attach` is the same bargain for BYTES: a rendered deliverable is read,
base64-encoded and sent as the artifact's file bundle, so an HTML page or a PNG
never passes through the model's context either. Attach a whole tree and the
paths below their common parent are preserved, so a page keeps resolving its
own `assets/…`. `--file`/`--stdin` stays the searchable text (give one so the
deliverable is findable).

Auth = the PLUGIN's own credential (shared `_memhub_auth`), never the /mcp
connector's: an explicit token if set (the `memhub_token` plugin option:
headless escape hatch), else the personal
access key `login.py` mints (`~/.config/memhub-plugin/pak-<host>.json`), else the
cached plugin OAuth token, else a one-time browser approval. Being connected
in /mcp does not satisfy it. No memhub-cli required.

Run (stdlib python3, nothing to install):
    python3 scripts/save_artifact.py \
        --file spec.md --name "Retry Policy Spec" --type spec \
        [--agent-brain-id <id>] [--parent-id <id>] [--rationale "..."] \
        [--tags a,b] [--topic billing]

    `--topic` is the brain chapter the document goes under — an existing topic
    of the brain when one fits even loosely, a new one only for a subject none
    covers, else "unsorted". A brain with topics on refuses a NEW artifact
    without one and lists its topics in the refusal; a new version keeps its
    topic when `--topic` is omitted. Outside a brain it is an ordinary tag.

    # a rendered DELIVERABLE (HTML page, chart PNG, PDF) — bytes, not text:
    python3 scripts/save_artifact.py \
        --attach report.html --attach chart.png --entrypoint report.html \
        --file summary.md --name "Q3 retry report" --type document

    # or pipe terminal output straight in:
    pytest -q | python3 scripts/save_artifact.py \
        --stdin --name "test run 2026-06-09" --type runbook

Endpoint resolution (so the script hits the SAME server the plugin connector
uses, by construction): --url > $MEMHUB_MCP_BASE_URL(+$MEMHUB_MCP_SERVER_PATH) >
the plugin's .mcp.json `mcpServers.*.url` > a default derived from the plugin
install path (prod for `memhub`, staging for `memhub-staging`). There is no
fixed fallback env — see `_memhub_auth.default_url`.

    """`(files payload, error)` for `--attach` — base64 bytes for `save_artifact`.

    A deliverable is often a TREE: `report.html` next to `assets/chart.png`,
    which the page references by that relative path. So the bundle path is each
    file's path relative to the common parent of everything attached —
    `--attach build/index.html --attach build/assets/chart.png` stores
    `index.html` and `assets/chart.png`, and the page still resolves its own
    asset. A single file keeps its basename. Flattening every attachment to its
    basename would upload a page whose scripts, styles and images all 404.

    The root is computed over the paths AS WRITTEN (`abspath`, which normalises
    `.`/`..` lexically), never `resolve()`. A deliverable's asset directory is
    often a symlink — `build/assets -> ../shared` — and resolving it replaces
    the path the page references with the link's target, so `build/assets/app.js`
    would be stored as `shared/app.js` and the page's own `assets/app.js` would
    404. The bytes are still read THROUGH the link; only the name follows what
    the caller wrote.
