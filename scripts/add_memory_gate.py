"""Deny ``add_memory`` in a session this plugin is already capturing (stdlib only).

**The failure.** ``add_memory`` exists for MCP clients with no capture hooks: the
caller passes one turn — what the user said, what the assistant replied — and
the server stores it as a conversation. In a Claude Code session running this
plugin that is never needed, because the ``Stop`` hook already uploads every
turn verbatim. Agents call it anyway, to make a finding "findable later" in a
brain, and they fill ``user_message`` with a paraphrase they wrote themselves.
The server stores that as a second conversation, whose user turn the user never
typed, and Studio lists it beside the real session. Blind live sessions on an
unmodified build, asked only to put a finished answer into a new brain, did
this more often than not (the trials are in the PR that added this file).
``save_artifact`` is the tool for what they were after, and the agents that
did not call ``add_memory`` used it.

**Why here and not on the server.** The server cannot know whether a client
captures its own sessions; only this plugin knows its ``Stop`` hook is live. So
the rule is scoped to exactly that condition and nothing wider:

* the tool is MemHub's ``add_memory`` — matched on the name's suffix AND on its
  ``user_message`` argument, so it covers this plugin's own server and a
  claude.ai MemHub connector alike (the blind agents used the connector) without
  catching an unrelated server's ``add_memory``;
* per-turn capture is not switched off (``MEMHUB_TURN_FLUSH=0``), and this is
  not the plugin's own child process (``MEMHUB_HARNESS_CHILD``), which the
  flush scripts never capture;
* the payload names a transcript, which is what the flush reads;
* the plugin holds a credential capture can authenticate with, judged by the
  same network-free check the capture-health banner uses — so this and that
  banner can never disagree about whether capture is running.

When any of those is false, capture is not happening and ``add_memory`` is the
only way to save the turn, so the call is allowed.

**Fails OPEN.** Any unexpected error allows the call: a broken guard must not
take a tool away from a session.
