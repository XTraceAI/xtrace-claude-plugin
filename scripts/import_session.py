"""Import a specific coding-agent session into MemHub — a terminal operation.

The transcript is read off disk and shipped straight to the
`import_conversation` MCP tool: the model never re-emits the content, so a
session of ANY size works.

Mirrors the SessionEnd hook's contract exactly:
- raw transcript records passed AS-IS (the tool auto-detects the Claude Code
  shape and runs agentic, tool-aware extraction)
- `conversation_id` = the session id (file stem) by default, so re-imports of
  the same session are INCREMENTAL: the server-side watermark admits only
  records it hasn't seen, and the session gist folds forward instead of
  duplicating.
- personal memory only: a session is never imported into a brain, the repo's
  room included. Team-visible knowledge goes in as artifacts.

Auth = the PLUGIN's own credential (shared `_memhub_auth`), never the /mcp
connector's: an explicit token if set (the `memhub_token` plugin option:
headless escape hatch), else the personal
access key `login.py` mints (`~/.config/memhub-plugin/pak-<host>.json`), else the
cached plugin OAuth token, else a one-time browser approval. Being connected
in /mcp does not satisfy it. No memhub-cli required.

Usage (stdlib python3, nothing to install):
    python3 import_session.py --session <session-id-or-path>
        [--conversation-id <id>] [--source-platform claude|codex|cursor]
        [--title "..."] [--url <mcp-url>]

`--session` accepts either a path to a .jsonl transcript or a bare session id,
which is resolved by searching ~/.claude/projects/*/<id>.jsonl.
