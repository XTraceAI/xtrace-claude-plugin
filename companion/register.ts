/**
 * The companion in the band above the prompt: MemHub's face in the session,
 * there to show what the plugin is doing for it. It sleeps while nothing
 * happens, looks around while Claude answers or you type, and rises to speak
 * when a MemHub rule fires, announcing the rule — calmly for an advisory,
 * crossly for a call the rule stopped — and when the harness has proposed a
 * new rule, presenting it and asking: Activate, Reject or Later, as buttons
 * inside its bubble (1, 2, 3 from an empty prompt) until it is answered.
 *
 * This is the whole of what watches the session. Which animal does the
 * sleeping and speaking is the Animal contract's business (see animal.ts):
 * the director asks for a pose and draws what comes back, and knows nothing
 * else about it. Every pose plays whole; it cuts in only where the animal is
 * merely waiting (asleep, looking).
 *
 * Which animal shows is the session's own (see selection.ts): picked from the
 * session id unless someone pinned one, and changed for this session alone by
 * `/hippo`, `/goose`, ... — each of which also takes `always` (pin it for
 * every new session), `random` (drop the pin), `never` / `include` (leave it
 * out of, or put it back in, the random pick), `off`, `on`, `auto`, and —
 * where the animal offers a demo — `demo` and its own pose names.
 *
 * A click on the ♥ beside its ground pets it. The animal itself cannot take
 * the click: a Raster takes none, and a surface module laid over it to take
 * them froze the pixels under it, while one laid beneath it never got them. A
 * proposal's `rule↗` opens the rule in MemHub Studio.
 *
 * The terminal draws the band as a Raster, repainted in place by `$.ui.blit`.
 * The desktop lists a Raster but draws nothing for one and refuses its blits,
 * so there the same cells are drawn as an SVG and each changed frame redraws
 * the band; its buttons sit in a row of their own, since a Box is placed in
 * cells and the SVG is sized in CSS pixels, which need not agree.
