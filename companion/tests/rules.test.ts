// What the companion announces from one classic PreToolUse / PostToolUse
// answer. The fixtures are the hooks' real output, not a paraphrase of it:
// DIRECTIVES is what the retired directive_recall._render() wrote (an older
// install can still write it beside this one), the Rulebook block's disclosure
// lines are rulebook_hook.disclosure_line() and disclosure_instruction(), and
// DENY is the shape of the hook's permissionDecisionReason. When the rulebook
// hook changes what it writes, regenerate these from it.
