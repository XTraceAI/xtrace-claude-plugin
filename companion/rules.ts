// What the MemHub rulebook hook (scripts/rulebook_hook.py) said on one tool
// call, read off the classic PreToolUse / PostToolUse answer it folds into:
// the rules that fired, each once, and whether the call was stopped by one.
//
// A fire is read from ONE shape: the disclosure line the hook writes for
// every rule it shows, `📏 Rule fired: <rule>` (advised) or `⛔️ Rule fired:
// <rule>` (stopped), the rule already in 20 words or fewer — rulebook_hook's
// `disclosure_line()`, the same string the terminal shows and the agent is
// told to echo. Nothing else counts. The `- **[<label>]** …` bullets beneath
// it are NOT read: the retired directive_recall.py wrote lessons and
// procedures as `- **[LESSON]** …` in the same classic answer (an older
// install can still be running beside this one), and a lesson that merely
// mentions the rulebook would be announced as a rule.
//
// The one fallback is a denied call's reason, and only the rulebook's own —
// `Blocked by the <brand> team rulebook:` then `- [<name>] …` — for a deny
// that arrives without its context.

// into the next line (the disclosure instruction's closing sentence).
